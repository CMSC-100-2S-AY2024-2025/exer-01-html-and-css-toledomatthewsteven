                My name is Matthew Steven Toledo, nickname: Steven. I was raised and spent most of my life in Muntinlupa, and I went to De La Salle Zobel for elementary and high school.
                Eventually, I was accepted into the BS Statistics program in the University of the Philippines Los Banos, but I soon shifted to the university's BS Computer Science program.  

                <br><br>
                That leads to now, where this website is made as part of a requirement for CMSC 100, a course included in the BS Computer Science curriculum. 

                <br><br>
                <i>Anyway, here's some trivia about me...</i>
                <br>
                My favorite video game of all time is Team Fortress 2. 
                As such, in some of my photos, I am cosplaying the Sniper! 
                I have also cosplayed Scout and Soldier; they are characters/classes from TF2 as well, and I hope to cosplay more soon.  
                My other favorite video games are Left 4 Dead 2 and ULTRAKILL. <br><br> 
                
                My favorite singers/artists are Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, and Stray Kids, 
                and my favorite anime is The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. I hope to cosplay Saiki K as well, even if my favorite character from that show is Aren Kuboyasu.<br>
                <br>
                Thanks for reading this "autobiography".
