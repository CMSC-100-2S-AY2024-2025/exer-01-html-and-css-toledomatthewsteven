                I am <i>totally</i> capable to take on web programming tasks, as I have had introductory experiences with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from back when I was in high school and 
                even to more recent years as particular exercises had use use these markup languages to create webpages. Even outside of creating projects or exercises, I use basic HTML tags 
                when I create bookmarks of my reading logs.
                <br><br>
                I am also experienced in taking on manager-like roles in projects that range from staying within the classroom, in external organizations, and in personal gatherings. 
                My ability to adapt to different environments and lead effectively has resulted in plentiful successful outcomes and positive experiences for everyone involved.

                <br><br>
                <i>Using these skills, I hope to enjoy my CMSC 100 course, titled Web Programming, so I can try to grasp and realize how much extensive labor is put into my favorite websites.</i>

                My name is Matthew Steven Toledo, nickname: Steven. I was raised and spent most of my life in Muntinlupa, and I went to De La Salle Zobel for elementary and high school.
                Eventually, I was accepted into the BS Statistics program in the University of the Philippines Los Baños, but I soon shifted to the university's BS Computer Science program.  

                <br><br>
                That leads to now, where this website is made as part of a requirement for CMSC 100, a course included in the BS Computer Science curriculum. 

                <br><br>
                <i>Anyway, here's some trivia about me...</i>
                <br>
                My favorite video game of all time is Team Fortress 2. 
                As such, in some of my photos, I am cosplaying the Sniper! 
                I have also cosplayed Scout and Soldier; they are characters/classes from TF2 as well, and I hope to cosplay more soon.  
                My other favorite video games are Left 4 Dead 2 and ULTRAKILL. <br><br> 
                
                My favorite singers/artists are Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, and Stray Kids, 
                and my favorite anime is The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. I hope to cosplay Saiki K as well, even if my favorite character from that show is Aren Kuboyasu.<br>
                <br>
                Thanks for reading this "autobiography".
