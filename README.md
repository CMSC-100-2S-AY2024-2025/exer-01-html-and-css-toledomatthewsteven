What are your key takeaways from this exercise?:
    I learned that it's hard to make an HTML/CSS website from scratch when all you do is throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks.
    It's important to have an idea of what you want your website to look like so that you are not just running around in circles trying to see what randomly looks best.
    Even if you don't receive your desired output, you can probably get something close to it... 
    I also learned that CSS has so much modifiers/terms that it is very easy to get super lost if you do not know these terms by heart and are not able to just think of it out of nowhere.
    Though expressing creativity is nice, this is a very difficult medium to work in.
